# Data Structures and Algorithms

Just some common algorithms and data structures.

## Description

Here there are many implementation of common algorithms and data structure.
On most of them, I will be using the language features and standard libraries,
so if you want actual implementations of structures like 
HashMap, Set, Stack, the most commons binary trees, etc. you won't find it here. 

## Technologies

- JVM 21
- Kotlin 2.1.x 
- The respective standard libraries
- Kotest 5.7.x
